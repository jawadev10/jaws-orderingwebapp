# Welcome to my Ordering Website ! =)

To take benefit of all the website, you need to run the backend. 
Open the folder Webotel Jawad 2.0 with your favourite IDE and launch it.

The Folder Gestion priv√© des clients is just a way to manage clients in the database. It's basically a Winform.

After starting the backEnd, you can directly open the folder Angular 7 and run it with the command : ng serve --open

Enjoy :D
